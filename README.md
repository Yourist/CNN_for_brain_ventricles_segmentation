# CNN for brain ventricles segmentation

### This is the result of making CNN for segmentation CT data at Neurostart hackaton. 

Here is the example of fully convolution artificial neural network for brain ventricles segmentation. This is the first step of "Personal 3D atlas of a brain" project. 
Developing of atlas based on FEFU (Far Eastern Federal University) with the help of Burdenko institute.

Thanks for the data and advises to Dmitry Samborsky, Arthur Biktimirov and staff of "CPD C 305" laboratory.
